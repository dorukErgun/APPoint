## Barber Shop in Your Neighbourhood
### User Story
The COVID-19 pandemic makes our lifes harder in many ways. Doruk lives
in a pretty crowded neighbourhood in Maltepe. Since the lockdown started,
barbers accept customers in a very short time intervals. One day Doruk goes
to barber shop and sees there is a 5 man queue in a small shop! When Doruk
asks the shop owner how long will it take for turn to come to him, shop owner
responds and suggest that he use APPoint to take appointments as he would
not have to wait in line, he would just basicly come in his time and get the job
done.
Doruk creates an APPoint account, selects the neighbourhood barber shop
and selects the date and time and then makes an appointment. He will not wait
in line next time.

### Scenario for Above Story
Initial assumption: Facility owners want to automise their facilities by working
with appointments, people want to get appointments from facilities in order
to lose less time on waiting.
Normal: User selects the category, facilities that belong to that category
showed to user. And then user selects the facility, facility information and
their calendar is showed to user. User selects a date with hour in order to get
an appointment date from the facility, by clicking submit, a notification is sent
to facility owner.
Facility may or may not accept that appointment date, the result of whether the
request was accepted or not accepted, sent to user. Facility calendar is updated
if the request was accepted.
What can go wrong: The facility owner did not see the appointment request.
The user should be informed about their request result as soon as possible. System
should make sure that facility owner sees the request by sending them and
email. If the respond time exceeded, request should considered not accepted
and the information should be sent to user.
What can go wrong: The user should log-in to website before trying to get
an appointment.
System state on completion: User logged-in, appointment request sent,
which is recieved by facility owner and the result of appointment request sent
back to user, facility calendar is updated.
